# Face-Swapping
In this project, I attempted to identify and swap two faces in a picture using OpenCV.The main aim was to explore the Cascade Classifier in OpenCV, which essentially detects objects using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers.
As can be seen from the code, it first detects the faces using detectMultiScale() which returns the coordinates of the faces detected.
It is verified by drawing a rectangle with the coordinates.
